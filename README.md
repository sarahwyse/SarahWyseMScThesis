SocialModel contains the code used in Chapter 2. Each file is labeled with the method used: ABM (agent based model), ODE (ordinary differential equation), or OpResp (opinion response functions).

ClimateModel contains the code used in Chapter 3. 

SocialClimateModel contains the code used in Chapter 4.

The Carbon_dioxide_Gt_CO2_yr file is data used in the climate and social-climate models and is pulled from: Gulev, S.K. et al. (2021). “Changing State of the Climate System”. In: Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis. Contribution of Working Group I to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Ed. by V. Masson-Delmotte et al.
